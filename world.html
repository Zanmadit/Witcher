    <h2>Novigrad</h2>
    <div class="manetext">
        <p>
            Before the First Landing, Novigrad was a small elven settlement. When the first human ships arrived in the Pontar Delta, the city was abandoned. It quickly became the capital of a new country created by king Sambuk, the ancestor of the first king of Redania.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Velen</h2>
    <div class="manetext">
        <p>
            The land of Velen, located in western Temeria with its capital in Gors Velen, is one of the poorest provinces in the kingdom. Its territory encompasses the isle of Thanedd, home to the famous magic academy, which, along with Gors Velen, constitutes the commercial and developmental mainspring of the entire province.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Skellige</h2>
    <div class="manetext">
        <p>
            Before the first appearance of a human, the isles were apparently inhabited and dominated by Aen Seidhe elves who shared it with giants and ice giants.
